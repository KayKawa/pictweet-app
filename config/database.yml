# As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your  password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your .
#
# Instead, provide the password or a full connection URL as an environment
# variable when you boot the app. For example:
#
#   _URL="mysql2://myuser:mypass@localhost/some"
#
# If the connection URL is provided in the special _URL environment
# variable, Rails will automatically merge its configuration values on top of
# the values provided in this file. Alternatively, you can specify a connection
# URL environment variable explicitly:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV["MY_APP__URL"] %>
#
# Read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-
# for a full overview on how  connection configuration can be specified.

production:
  <<: *default
